Encryption and Decryption
Password Encryption is the process of transforming data into a form that cannot be deciphered. The new message is completely different from the old one. Because of this, a hacker cannot read the data sent because it is encrypted. To decrypt data, it must be converted into a form that is readable and understandable to both humans and computers, which is known as the password decoding process. It is possible to use this method to decrypt the text by hand or by re-using the encryption keys that were originally used to encrypt it.

Weak and Secure Strong Password
A weak password is one that is short, common, a system default, or one that can be quickly guessed using a subset of all possible passwords, such as dictionary terms, proper names, words based on the user name, or popular variations on these themes. The most important features of a strong password are length (the longer the better), a mix of letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and symbols, and no linkages to your personal information.
